SMC: 20 sampled plans of 50 districts on 2,500 units
`adapt_k_thresh`=0.985 • `seq_alpha`=0.5
`est_label_mult`=1 • `pop_temper`=0
Plan diversity 80% range: 0.011 to 0.378
✖ WARNING: Low plan diversity
Sampling diagnostics for SMC run 1 of 1 (20 samples)
• Watch out for low effective samples, very low acceptance rates (less than
1%), large std. devs. of the log weights (more than 3 or so), and low numbers
of unique plans. R-hat values for summary statistics should be between 1 and
1.05.
• Low diversity: Check for potential bottlenecks. Increase the number of
samples. Examine the diversity plot with `hist(plans_diversity(plans),
breaks=24)`. Consider weakening or removing constraints, or increasing the
population tolerance. If the acceptance rate drops quickly in the final splits,
try increasing `pop_temper` by 0.01.
